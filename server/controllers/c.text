controller handles reuqest flow, is the first thing from user before model/view
// controller NEVER interact with data logic, only use model for the interactions, tells model what to do 
// controllers handle fail/ success, model only handle data

1. reuqest
2. get data (model) and send data to controller
3. ger presentation, controller -> view


Views -> handle data presentation, dynamic render (react frotnend portion?) (html stuff!)
Model and View never interact
