Models handle dat logic
interact with db


After initializing Sequelize, we don’t need to write CRUD functions, Sequelize supports all of them:
create a new User: create(object)
find a User by id: findByPk(id)
find a User by email: findOne({ where: { email: ... } })
get all Users: findAll()
find all Users by username: findAll({ where: { username: ... } })

The association between Users and Roles is Many-to-Many relationship:
– One User can have several Roles.
– One Role can be taken on by many Users.
